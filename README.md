# 📌 Overview

The **E-Commerce Intelligence Platform** is an end-to-end batch data engineering project built on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**.

It demonstrates how modern organizations ingest raw business data, validate data quality, build scalable data warehouse layers, orchestrate transformations, monitor pipelines, and deliver analytics-ready datasets for business intelligence.

The project follows the **Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)** and implements production-oriented engineering practices including audit logging, metadata management, data quality testing, orchestration, monitoring, and automated workflows.

# 🎯 Business Problem

E-commerce organizations receive data from multiple operational systems every day.

Without a structured pipeline:

- inconsistent data enters analytics
- duplicate records reduce trust
- failed uploads are difficult to trace
- business reports become unreliable
- pipeline failures go unnoticed

This platform solves those problems by creating a scalable and automated cloud-native data engineering pipeline.
